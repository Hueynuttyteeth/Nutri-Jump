1 - Getting the Platform (GameMaker).

2 - Getting Steam (Optional!)

3 - Getting the Project.

4 - Starting it up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*1* Getting the Platform (GameMaker).

GameMaker can be found on http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker/studio.
First you are going to need to scroll down an click "Download" for GameMaker: Studioâ„¢. 
Once you have it downloaded, Install it, an just use Defaults for everything.
Once it is installed, Ask Mr. Teschner for the Product key for the Master Suite. 
When you launch GameMaker it should ask for key. just Plug in that key and you are set.
So why GameMaker over something else? 
GameMaker was just introduced on Steam, A gaming place to purchase and play 
Computer games for all Platforms. When we started this project, they had just 
started to release Software such as GameMaker which is why we used it.

*2* Getting Steam (Optional!)

This is completely optional, but is very handy. First, go to http://store.steampower
ed.com/ Then at the top right of the screen do "Install Steam". Then click "Install Steam Now"
on the new page, You may need an Admin to sign off on the UAC protection. Once steam is installed,
use a CAPS steam account to sign into Steam. 
Once you are logged in, Go to the Store page, then in the navigation bar at the top,
click software. Once on the Software page, scroll down until you find GameMaker: Studio 
(It shouldn't have a Purple line in top left corner of the Thumbnail that says DLC).
Click the "Free" button to start your Install and follow the Directions shown to install. 
It may take a minute to do so.

*3* Getting the Project.

So now you have GameMaker: Studio Installed, now you need to get the project to load up 
to even start working where we let off. First, go to https://github.com/Hueynuttyteeth/Nutri-Jump/. 
You should find the file "Prototype 4". This is the compressed/Exported project file from GameMaker.
Just download it and save it somewhere in a folder where you won't lose it.

*4* Starting it up.

Now that you have The Project you can now continue where we left off.
First thing you need to do is to Start up GameMaker. Now go to Import 
and find the Project file where you saved it. Open it up and you should be good to go!
